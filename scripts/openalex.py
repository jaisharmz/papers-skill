"""OpenAlex: coauthorship edges, and affiliations if you read the right field.

Measured against a real traversal, twice, because the first measurement was
wrong and the correction matters more than the original finding:

  coauthorship edges      reliable. Who wrote what with whom and when comes from
                          the paper itself and is the graph's backbone.
  last_known_institutions a LIST, and its first element is not the most recent.
                          Reading [0] returns "Berkeley College" for someone at
                          Together AI and "BioQ Pharma" for someone at Stanford.
                          Do not use it.
  affiliations[]          institution plus the years it was seen. Ranked on
                          sustained recency this resolves 6-7 of 8 spot checks
                          correctly, and the failures come back with low
                          confidence rather than confidently wrong.
  per-paper authorship
  institution             accurate when present, present on 8 of 73 authorships,
                          absent on the recent preprints that matter.

The one real defect left is profile conflation: OpenAlex merges some distinct
people into a single author record. "Junxiong Wang" carries 198 works and
resolves to a plausible institution at high confidence while being at least two
people. Works count wildly out of line with career stage is the tell.

Deterministic. No judgment about who is worth expanding lives here.
